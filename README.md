# Raegan's Hangman Browser Game - Project 1

### How to Play

Welcome to my Hangman browser game (figure 1)! 

Try and guess the secret "SEI" word by selecting letters on the keyboard.  If you guess a letter correctly, it will appear in the appropriate blank (figure 2).  If you guess a letter incorrectly, you will lose a life (figure 3).  Try and guess all of the correct letters in the word before your man is hung (figure 4)!
